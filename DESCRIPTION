Description: Abridged data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for years 2003-2016. The ATUS is an annual survey conducted on a sample of individuals across the United States studying how individuals spent their time over the course of a day. Individual respondents were interviewed about what activities they did, during what times (rounded to 15 minute increments), at what locations, and in the presence of which individuals. The activities are subsequently encoded based on 3 separate tier codes for classification. This package includes data from the multi-year ATUS Activities, ATUS-CPS, and ATUS Respondents files were included. Columns were selected based on completeness of data as well as presence on the Frequently Used Variables list provided by the ATUS website. All activity codes (other than code '50' for 'Unable to Code') were included. Permission was obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for inclusion in this package. The full data can be obtained from <http://www.bls.gov/tus/>.
